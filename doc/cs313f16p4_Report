Pair development Journey:
    We developed and worked on this project in separate locations but kept in touch with each other
    through slack: discussing what we had done, problems we are having, solutions to problems, and
    giving each other feedback on the work we had done. Through this constant feedback and discussion
    we were able to work very well together on making design decisions, refactoring, and having a better
    understanding of the code.

Relationship between state machine model and actual code:
    The similarities between the state model and the actual code is the functionality of program and
    how each of the states are interacting with each other. Further, this translates into how similar
    the structure of the two are in comparison to each other. Which in this case makes writing and
    understanding the code a lot easier. The differences are in the details, specifically the code
    is more complex and has more of the details vs the state machine model which displays the main
    functional details that are important to running the program. In this case and in many others,
    is is a lot more effective to model first, but there is a limitation to this. State modeling like
    what we did proved to be very helpful. But when you get into modeling every single piece structure
    in the program, this is ineffective. To conclude, we would not make an changes to the model because
    it is simple and easy to understand the concept of the state model. In adding or deleting anything
    would make the model too complex or too simple for use.
